Ecommerce with Wordpress and WooCommerce - TeamTreeHOuse


1. Introduction to Ecommerce with WordPress

2. Setting Up WooCommerce
	- 6. Shipping Settings in WooCommerce 
		-- create a shipping class
		-- products->shipping classes (taxonomy)
		-- more advanced shipping options - (Table Rate Shipping Plugin, Fedex, UPS, US Postal Service)
		
		
3. Managing Products in WooCommerce

	- 2. Different Types of Products in WooCommerce
	  -- https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/
	  -- product types: simple, grouped, external or affiliate, variable
	  
	- 3. Setting Up a Simple Product  
	  -- virtual: no shipping
	  -- downloadable: (digital)
	  -- sale: schedule (note: if sale price is removed, the frontend display will also be updated)
	  -- inventory: manage stock
	  -- shipping class: (default-flat rate)
	  -- Linked Products: 
			--- Up-sells- alternative expensive products, Cross-sells- alternative similar products, related products
			--- grouping: choose what products to group
	  -- Attributes: Size S|M|L (visible on prod. page)  ex. ISBN, author, publisher, other specifications, product details
	  -- advanced: reviews, menu order, purchase notes
	  
	- 4. Setting Up a Grouped Product 
	  - sell separate individual products into one
	  - after grouped product item is made, you need to add all individual items for this group so you can see the price of the bundle.
			-- if an simple product item is made,  
				--- you can now select the grouping: name (bundle)
			    --- assign a shipping class (refer #2.6)
	  - Download Type: (e.g. Music) check shema.org (Search engines can easily identify what you are selling)
	  
	- 5. External or Affiliate Products in WooCommerce 
		-- selling products from 3rd party (e.g. products posted in amazon can be linked)
		(tip: it is best to write your own description to avoid technical duplicates from 3rd party sites.)
		-- Product URL: use a shorten url (e.g. Amazon)
		-- Button text: (e.g. Buy on Amazon)
	    -- featured Images (tip: make sure not just copy image for copyright issues)
	  
	-  6. How Variable Products Work in WooCommerce
		-- similar to Simple Products but with options (e.g. color, size)
		-- Attributes: Size S|M|L (visible on prod. page)  
				--- check: used for variations
		-- Variation: (note: if used for variations is checked, there will be a new button: Add Variation)
			- This will be good for colors, sizes, etc.
	  
	-  7. Product Reviews
		-- comment approval review (moderator to avoid spam)
		-- Go to WooCommerce Settings->Products->Product Ratings->enable ratings 
			
	  
	  
4. Managing Orders in WooCommerce  

	- 1. Setting Up Test Orders in WooCommerce
		-- a few options to test by creating new accounts & fake purchases
		   a. coupons 
				-- General: Discount type: Cart % Discount
				-- usage restrictions: email
				-- apply coupon, checkout
		   b. Settings->checkout
				-- COD enabled 
				-- Enable COD if order is virtual
					(In cart, instead of applying coupon discount, use COD in checkout & place order)
		   c.  Setup sandbox with other payment gateways
				-- settings->Checkout->Paypal->Enable Paypal Sandbox (developer.paypal.com -> create account)
					-> test account as store owner (email)
					-> test account as customer
					-> https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/
				-- settings->Checkout->Stripe
					-> expensive plugin but easy to setup for testing payments (Card Number & Card type)
					-> https://stripe.com/docs/testing
				-- use SMTP Mail & activate for testing local payment gateways	by receiving email notification upon checkout
					
	- 2. The Order Section in WooCommerce
		-- order information section
		-- get email notifications
		-- all info should above should be accessible in Admin Area
		-- Test by ordering & checkout (2-3 emails would be helpful in testing & create an account after ordering). Use COD upon testing.
			-> order received confirmation page (Checkout, Order Details, Customer Details,  Billing Address)
			-> checkout the order info. design when email is received
			-> If customer logs into their account, list of recent orders will be displayed (order status)
			-> Orders: Displays all item orders that have been placed by customers.

	- 4. Refunds in WooCommerce
		-- NOTE: -- Some need API information inserted in order for refunds to work (like Paypal Integration). 
		         -- Process the refund on Paypal's Site & come back to your site & mark
