		- about.us, contact, menu, reservations, sample page
	- choose post page (blog)

03_11-Adding featured content to the front page
	- (customizer) "featured" tag  - this may okay but the huge text covers the header picture, it doesn't display long title well enough.
	- better hide it in the customizer
