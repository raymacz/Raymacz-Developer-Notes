#06 006 Creating and activating a child theme
  - tip: just reference the Parent CSS file (not copy/paste the CSS code) using @import
  - a better way to load CSS efficiently https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes
  - you create a new theme instead if you want to overwrite the whole css
#008 Bringing in the parent theme stylesheet(s)
  - Some themes offer complex CSS with multiple loads w/c brings more load than its worth.
#009 009 Employing the laziness principle
  - Reuse Code whenever possible. Makes a lot simpler.
#012 Adding new styles
  - When a post is set to sticky, a class sticky will be added to class name
#015 Understanding the WordPress template hierarchy
  https://wphierarchy.com/
  - if templates are not found (main or child themes), wordpress will automatically go up the heirarchical tree until it defaults to index.php.
#016 Show Current Template plugin to identify current template
  - Use this plugin to determine what wordpress is currently using
  https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-current-template/
    note: this theme will show all the template parts its currently using including the parent & child theme
#017 Changing an existing template file
  - the child theme is able to change different components of the parent theme.
  - Being able to change anything using the child theme without touching the parent theme and breaking it.
  - note: replace an identical file from parent theme is overidden by child theme
	-- e.g. from parent-theme/single.php to child-theme/single.php
#018 Adding new template files
  - Wordpress let's you choose which template to display http://storage7.static.itmages.com/i/17/0816/h_1502915380_4451584_1020692780.png
  - create a folder "page-templates"
  - Customized Page Template shold be name page-<name>.php  e.g. "page-sidebar-right.php"
#019 Challenge - Add a template for the Aside post type
  - an Aside in wordpress are one of the post formats. Usually they have titles & contain minimal information
     found in the bottom of the front page (e.g. date & other meta info.)
  - http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/17/0817/h_1502961828_2670528_6a49ba1b59.png
#020 Solution - Add a template for the Aside post type
  - To overwrite the parent by a child theme, we need to copy the same folder structure.
  - To override any template, always check first the root index.php of the parent theme for instructions
#021 Understanding and using the functions.php file
  - functions, classes, methods, hooks, https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/
  - all themes have functions.php & used for 2 purposes:
    1. features of theme: add theme support (e.g. featured image sizes, post format, custom menu configuration, javascripts, stylesheets)
    2. Hold for custom function for child theme: (e.g. modification of parent functios & new functions)
  - well built theme have hookable functions that allow child theme to override
  - hookable function - wrapped in a conditional statement that checks if a function already exist in a child theme
  - if you hook a function in a child theme (same function name), it will be ran in place of the parent's function
      http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/17/0817/h_1502982838_1412979_ac6cf181e3.png
  - functions.php in child is called before the parent's functions.php. Both run consecutively.

#022 Giving the child theme a text domain
  - wordpress is equipped w/ transalation engine
  - load_theme_textdomain() - function used for translation available for the theme
  - to add child functions.php  <parent theme name>_setup.php to <parent theme name>_child_setup.php
  - override a parent function sample -  (e.g. load_theme_textdomain() --> load_child_theme_textdomain()
    https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/load_child_theme_textdomain/
  - textdomains - $domain are child or parent theme name. (e.g. popper, popper-child)
  - to make translation work, one must change all reference in the child templates (e.g. popper --> popper-child)
     http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/17/0817/h_1502969943_6920129_121395ad41.png
#023 Changing a function used by a template file
  - To change output of a certain function in child template only
  - In the later years, wordpress moved custom functions into a separate file to avoid functions.php from becoming too big.
  - To change the function output of parent theme, one must look to each of the templates in the child
       Steps to modify a function in a template:
      1. Use Show Current Template plugin  http://storage4.static.itmages.com/i/17/0817/h_1502973862_4815378_982c3dbed0.png

  - Core items (e.g. Custom Menu, Sidebar) are usually found in functions.php
  - steps to create a menu in footer
    1. Enable Primary Menu in Customizer
    2. functions.php - find "nav_menu" & copy to child http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/17/0817/h_1502993677_4728710_1db5578d9d.png
    3. WP Customize - Menu Locations - enable the new custom menu (menu is now loaded the WP Core ready for Display)
    4. header.php - Check home page where primary menu was enabled & then check header.php template
    5. footer.php - create a new footer.php in child theme folder & duplicate parent content.
                  - Insert by pasting the code (nav_menu snippet) from header.php
                  - http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/17/0817/h_1502995892_6296014_18117947eb.png
    6. WP Customize - Go Back & choose what type of data to display in Menu
#027 Changing the menu output with properties
  - creating lots of menu in the site might be a bad experience to site visitors
  - make decision for customers on what's best for your site. Make themes a bit restrictive by making it easier to work with.
  - Footer Menu Should only be top menu links
  - check the parameters for customizing menu  https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/
#028 Styling the new menu with CSS
  - display:flex, flex-wrap: wrap, list-style-type:none;
#029 Challenge - Add a new widgetized area to the footer
#030 Solution - Add a new widgetized area to the footer
  - sidebars are widgetized areas (even before the early days of WP - reason why function is called register_sidebar)
  - widgets can be placed anywhere
  - steps:
    1. functions.php - copy the code inside the function popper_widgets_init() & paste to child theme
    2. Change the fuction name because its not hookable, meaning the function name is common.
      http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/17/0818/h_1503071610_8032459_6707d30bda.png
    3. sidebar.php - widgets are usually displayed in this theme, find the code responsible for output in the template.

  best tip: post formats 
	  - can be activated in functions.php https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats
      - an Aside in wordpress are one of the post formats. Usually they have titles & contain minimal information
			1. you create a post & choose a certain post format like aside
			2. next step is to display that post format content 
				a. create content-aside.php & customize the layout the way you like
				b. 	add this to index.php or any template & it will call the correct template for the post format
					get_template_part( 'template-parts/content', get_post_format() ) ); 
				tip: a good example is the auberge-child theme which I made
