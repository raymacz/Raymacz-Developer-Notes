-----------------------------------
WARRANTY


Usually in standard web development contracts (popular) in freelancing.
Warranty on fixing issues are not usually indicated / specified. Once the product has been delivered (w/ client's approval),
it is usually final.  It is the responsibility of the client to thoroughly check & review it.

As for me, I am giving clients a period of 7-day (based on date) for clients to review their product & see any overlooked issues.


Conditions:
As much as possible, there shouldn't be any changes or code revisions during this period that is directly related to the work I've done.  
Some fixes made by other developers on your website may somehow affect, in some cases conflict with my code.

In the future, please make sure to hire developers that follow the best practices to avoid future issues. Thank you.

----------------------------------------------------------
PER HOUR or PACKAGE WORK

if fixing would require more than a day, I usually would recommend per hour.
	
Building a website from scratch if it's simple with fewer pages is much easier to estimate.
(like a single home page with a blog around 5 pages) - So this can be a package work.
If it becomes more complex than that & harder to predict or estimate, I usually would recommend per hour.

Dear Christine,

With all due respect, I was surprised when you said that I would only bill you 3-hours.
When we started working october 26,2018.  To think $5/hour for a Wordpess Web Developer 
is very low.   The minimum australia wage is $18/hour - https://www.screencast.com/t/z9XXKE5qLgyo 
To give you a clear understanding on the scope I covered:


SUMMARY:

102618 (6 hours)
102718 ( 1 hour)
102918 (4 hours)
103018 (3 hours)
103118  (3 hours)
			
TOTAL: 17-hours

17*5 =  $85

This includes our conversation, Tracing & understanding how your theme was coded
with no documentation. 
Working hours for styling and plugin functionality setup
Modification and revisions
